        <p>To my serenity,<br><br>

            You will always be my peace. In spite of my chaos, you bring healing to my soul, even when I resist it. You have a way of reaching me that I can't deny. Today, I may not be fully healed yet, and the disasters of my past may sometimes resurface, but I can keep moving forward because of the book you gave me and your unwavering support. I will always cherish this and be forever grateful to you.<br><br>
            
            Please stay serene always. You are my role model. When I feel down or when everything falls apart, I think about how you handle struggles, and it helps me get back on track.<br><br>
            
            I've grown attached to you, and I'm scared of what might come next. I'll do my best to ensure nothing jeopardizes our friendship. May God bless you always. I wish you all the best. Be successful, help your family, and prove to those who doubted you that they were wrong. You control your fate.
            <br><br>With gratitude and admiration,<br> - Kaloy </p>
